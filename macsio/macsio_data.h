\brief Randomization and Pseudo Random Number Generators

@{

MACSio creates and initializes several pseudo random number generators (PRNGs),
all of which utilize the C standard library
<a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/random.3.html">random()</a>
method.

Pseudo Random Number Generator (PRNG) support is handled by maintaining
a series of state vectors for calls to initstate/setstate of C library
random() and friends. Multiple different PRNGs are supported each having
zero or more special properties depending on how they are initialized
(e.g. seed used from run to run and/or from rank to rank). However,
properties of a PRNG also depend on usage. For example, if a PRNG is
intended to cause each rank to generate same data, then it is up to the
caller to ensure it is called consistently (e.g. collectively) across ranks.
Otherwise, indeterminent behavior will result.

The PRNGs MACSio creates are...

- "naive": The naive prng is fine for any randomization that does not need special behaviors.
  This is the one that is expected to be used most of the time. 
- "naive_tv": is like naive except that it is seeded based on current time and so
  will change from run to run (e.g. is Time Varying). It should be used in place
  of naive where randomization from run to run is desired.
- "naive_rv": like naive but ensures variation across ranks by seeding based on rank
- "naive_rtv": like naive_rv but also varies from run to run 
- "rank_invariant": is neither seeded based on rank or time nor shall be used in way that would
  cause inconsistency across ranks. It is up to the caller to ensure it is called
  consistently (e.g. collectively) across ranks. Otherwise indeterminent behavior
  may result.
- "rank_invariant_tv": like rank_invariant except causes variation in randomization from run to run

If these PRNGs are not sufficient, developers are free to create other PRNGs for
other specific purposes.
